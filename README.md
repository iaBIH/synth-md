# SynthMD: Synthetic Datasets for Software Development in Rare Disease Research

This repository contains the [code](https://github.com/iaBIH/synth-md/edit/main/https://github.com/iaBIH/synth-md/tree/bihmi/synthMD) and [datasets](https://github.com/iaBIH/synth-md/edit/main/RDdata/result) for our paper [Synthetic Datasets for Software Development in Rare Disease Research]() (to be published). 

The tool is used to generate synthetic datasets with 187,709 patients for three popular rare diseases i.e. 

* [Sickle Cell Disease](https://github.com/iaBIH/synth-md/edit/main/RDdata/result/scd_patients_all_100403.csv) (SCD), ORPHA code: 232.
* [Cystic Fibrosis](https://github.com/iaBIH/synth-md/edit/main/RDdata/result/cf_patients_all_32093.csv]) (CF), ORPHA code: 586.
* [Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy](https://github.com/iaBIH/synth-md/edit/main/RDdata/result/dmd_patients_all_55219.csv) (DMD), ORPHA code: 98896.

Each dataset has 10+ attributes including patient personal information and clinical parameters.

The synthetic data follow the input census and disease statistics with high accuracy.
