# SynthMD: Synthetic Datasets for Software Development in Rare Disease Research

This repository contains the code and the datasets for our paper [Synthetic Datasets for Software Development in Rare Disease Research]() (to be published). 

The tool is used to generate [synthetic datasets](https://github.com/iaBIH/synth-md/edit/main/RDdata) with 187,709 patients for three popular rare diseases i.e. [Sickle Cell Disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sickle_cell_disease#:~:text=Sickle%20cell%20disease%20(SCD)%20is,like%20shape%20under%20certain%20circumstances.) (SCD, ORPHA code: 232), [Cystic Fibrosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystic_fibrosis) (CF, ORPHA code: 586), and [Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchenne_muscular_dystrophy) (DMD, ORPHA code: 98896). 
Each dataset has 10+ attributes including patient personal information and clinical parameters.

The synthetic data follow the input census and disease statistics with high accuracy.
